What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source containerization platform by which you can pack your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are light in weight which makes them portable and they are isolated from the underlying infrastructure and from each other container. You can run the docker image as a docker container in any machine where docker is installed without depending on the operating system.

Docker is popular because of the following:

Portability.
Reproducibility.
Efficiency.
Scalability.


What is Dockerfile?
The Dockerfile uses DSL (Domain Specific Language) and contains instructions for generating a Docker image. Dockerfile will define the processes to quickly produce an image. While creating your application, you should create a Dockerfile in order since the Docker daemon runs all of the instructions from top to bottom.

It is a text document that contains necessary commands which on execution help assemble a Docker Image.
Docker image is created using a Docker file.
Dockerfile is the source code of the image
